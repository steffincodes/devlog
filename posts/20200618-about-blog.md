So the other day I was looking through my twitter feed and came accross this guy [tejaz](https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_) and his [troll blog](https://tej.as/) hosted for the public to see in [github](https://github.com/TejasQ/tejaskumar.com) and the first thing I saw was the git [commit history](https://github.com/TejasQ)

That's when I plugged in my laptop cracked my knuckles and started to search on how to make a smooth [blog](https://tej.as/blog/1579543554591__5-things-i-love-about-my-website) without having to look at the inspired code.

For a person who was originally into [PureCSS images](https://codepen.io/collection/nVyPpo) and who just recently entered the realm of [JS](https://codepen.io/collection/DdJeqb) with the help of [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/steffin-codes) (At the time of writing this post I was in OOPS concept).

So given that kinda background I had to research a lot inorder to figure out what I have done, and honestly I don't understand why some of the feature work and why some of don't [codepen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/AeyjPj)

What I wanna accomplish by creating this blog:

- [ ] 💪🏻 Create one post every day 
- [x] 📝 Create posts using markdown 
- [x] 🗃 Use and thereby learn about Next.js 
- [ ] 🔀 Use Github's Issue and pull request functionality
- [x] 🗒️ Create a headless CMS useable blog
- [ ] 🧽 Cleanup the styles from the scripts 
- [ ] Make proper layout
- [ ] Use SSR [Used getStaticProps()](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)

More rantings in the the near future 🥴
